# To Do List II - The Sequel

My second To Do List project that I created, this time around being way more comfortable using event bubbling selections, traversing the DOM, as well as using the local storage to persist data.

## Usage

The user can add any specified item to the list by providing the desired value in the input bar and pressing enter.

The user can delete each particular item by pressing the "trash can" icon and also edit each item's value by pressing the "pencil" icon which will immediately replace it with the current value of the input bar. 

The user can also filter the available item in the list by providing a query for the seach bar situated at the top. 

The "Clear All" button will erase all the items from the list not only from the DOM but also from local storage.

## Project lookback and future considerations 

This was my second time trying to create a to do project and this time around it definitely felt significantly easier and I also learned how to implement a search functionality thanks to a Shaun Pelling's (The Net Ninja) tutorial. 

I also practiced a bit with using Bootstrap for this project but I personally prefer and will stick to practicing with simple HTML and CSS (planning on learning Sass as well as soon as possible) for future projects.
